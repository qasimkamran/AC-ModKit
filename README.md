# Assetto Corsa Modkit

I built this app for it to act as a helper program, automating any of my modding workflows for Assetto Corsa that can be. The killer for my productivity happened to be all of those tedious tasks which kept me from moving to the next step in my workflow before I could ultimately test my changes in-game. Anything that can be automated along the way, this app should be there to accomodate.
